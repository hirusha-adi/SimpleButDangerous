*This only works with WINDOWS* 

every file inside the "Files" folder is a normal text file (ending with the .txt extension)
you will have to rename your file to .bat before using it

some files must be in the .vbs format, check the files names i have uploaded, if it says to rename it to .vbs then you will have to fo it before using, if nothing is mentioned, you will have to rename it as .bat

----------------------------------------

if you are unable to see the file extension and rename it,
click of start and search for folder options,
open folder options, 
click on View,
scroll down and uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types" and click apply,
close it :-)
